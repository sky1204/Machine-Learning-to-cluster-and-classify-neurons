#Classifying burst originators neurons and clustering brain connectome using simulated data

In this project we used machine learning algorithms for classifying neurons into burst originators and non-burst originators. Then we used clustering algorithm to group the neurons into MBLs and non-MBLs. Then, we tried to classify neurons as Major Burst Leaders (MBLs) based on other easily calculated features. 
The machine learning analysis has been done in Python 

###Libraries and packages used in Python: 
•	Numpy
•	Array
•	Sklearn
•	Statsmodel.api
•	Pandas
•	Matplotlib
•	Time

##Files to run final model:
•	ClassifyingBurstNonBurst.py: This classifies the neurons as bursting or non-bursting. This evaluated the models and plots a graph comparing the accuracy for all the models.
•	classifyingClusteringLabels.py: This classifies neurons based on the labels generated by the clustering algorithms. This generates a graph evaluating the various algorithms accuracy.
